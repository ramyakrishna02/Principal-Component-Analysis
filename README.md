# Principal Component Analysis
PCA is a technique for dimensionality reduction that identifies a set of orthogonal axes, called principal components, that capture the maximum variance in the data. PCA can be used to reduce the number of features or dimensions in a dataset while preserving the most important patterns or relationships between the variables. PCA can also be used to visualize high-dimensional data in lower dimensions, such as 2D or 3D plots. 

Some of the benefits of PCA are:
. It can improve the performance and efficiency of machine learning models by reducing the computational complexity and avoiding overfitting.
. It can help to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data that are not obvious in the original features.
. It can help to remove noise or irrelevant information from the data by discarding the principal components with low variance.
